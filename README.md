# Favorita-Project
# Retail Demand Forecasting App

This project is part of the Masterschool Data Analyst program. The goal is to build a demand forecasting app for the **Guayas** region, predicting product sales for the first quarter of 2014 using historical data and a machine learning model.

## Project Purpose

Retailers need accurate demand forecasting to optimize inventory, reduce waste, and improve logistics. This project helps demand planners visualize sales forecasts interactively and export predictions when needed.

## Model Choice & Performance

We tested multiple models during Sprint 3 and selected **XGBoost Regressor** due to its high accuracy and efficiency.

-  **Best Model:** XGBoost Regressor  
-  **Validation RMSE:** 15.6919  
-  **Forecast Range:** Jan–Mar 2014  
-  **Region:** Guayas  
-  **Product Families:** GROCERY I, BEVERAGES, CLEANING  

The model was trained on historical sales data from 2013 using features like promotions, holidays, store, and item information.
